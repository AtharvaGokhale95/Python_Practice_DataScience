Following are the key take-away from the solutions:

1. Two Sums
    1. To maintain 2 pointers, TC for list is O(n2) while for dict is O(n)
    2. When you run enumerate() on a list in Python, it returns an enumerate object that produces pairs of index and element as you loop over it
    3. In a standard Python dictionary, you canâ€™t directly look up a key by its value, you can only lookup for the value using its key
    4. When we run "if val in dict" it always only looks of the keys if present in the dict and returns its value
    5. Whenever we lookup with a value in dict, we always pass a value of a key

2. Ways to call the function defined inside a class:
    1. Create a instance of a class and then call the method: object.method(parameters)
    2. Directly using the Class name: Class.method(object, parameters)

3. isPalindrome:
    1. Using string/ list reversal: list = list[::-1]
    2. Using while loop: while head < tail, head = 0 and tail = len(str) - 1

4. Roman to Integer:
    1. When we want to keep a track of the current_value, previous_value and total_value, initialize previous_value and total_value == 0
    2. Update the previous_value with the value already looped on: previous_value = current_value
    3. Update the total_value based on the logic

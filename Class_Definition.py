p = Person("Atharva")        # Now we have created an instance/ object of class Person - p is instance of class Person
# If we have passed any arguement apart from self to the __init__ function, we need to pass the value for that arguement every time we create an instance of that class
# Thus, the __init__ method is called automatically when we create a instance of a class
# p.introduce()

#When you call p.introduce(), Python implicitly passes the instance p as the first argument â€” that's self.
#Then inside introduce, you're calling self.greet(), which again passes the same self to the greet method

# Person.static_method()
# This is a static method - This does not depend on the instance of the class 
# If I have would have called it as: p.static_method() it will throw an error. As the __init__ method expects an arguement to be passed, whereas the static_method is not having any arguement

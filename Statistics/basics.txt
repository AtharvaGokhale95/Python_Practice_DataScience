1. ML Algorithms:
    1. Making Prediction for a continuous value
    2. Classification

2. Types of data used in ML models:
    1. Training data - I/P features and the O/P label - This data is used to train the model
    2. Testing data - I/P features and the O/P label - This data is used to test the performance of the model
    3. Prediction data - Finally when the ML models best fits the testing data, we make the predictions for the Prediction data

2. We use Training data to evaluate the ML model and not the training data. Thus, how well the ML models fits the Training data is not the right measure

3. Fitting the Training data well, but making poor predictions, is called Bias-Variance Tradeoff 
    1. Bias: It means the liner model is more biased on a particular parameter. E.g: model that assumes price is only based on area (ignores location, age, etc)
